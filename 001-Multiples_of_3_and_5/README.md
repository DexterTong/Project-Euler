To compile:
$ javac Main.java

To run:
$ java Main

Input: 
Same format as the ProjectEuler+ HackerRank challenge; each argument is separated by a newline, in which the first is 
the number of tests to run, denoted t, and the subsequent lines are the individual tests, (n1,...,nt). In this case, for each test i,
 find the sum of the multiples of 3 and 5 that are less than the test value ni.

$ java Main
$ t
$ n1
$ n2
$ .
$ .
$ .
$ nt

Output:
The result of each test, separated by newlines.
