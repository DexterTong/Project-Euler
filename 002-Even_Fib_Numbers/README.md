To compile:
$ gcc main.c

To run:
$ ./a.out

Input:
Same format as the ProjectEuler+ HackerRank challenge; each argument is separated by a newline, in which the first is
the number of tests to run, denoted t, and the subsequent lines are the individual tests, (n1,...,nt). In this case, for each test i,
 find the sum of the even Fibonacci numbers less than the specified number.

Output:
The sum of the even Fibonacci numbers for each case, separated by a newline, and in chronological order.
